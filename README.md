# Tailwind CSS Not Picking Up Styles

This repository demonstrates a common issue where Tailwind CSS fails to process styles from components.  The problem likely stems from an incorrectly configured `content` array in your Tailwind configuration file (`tailwind.config.js` or `tailwind.config.cjs`).

## Problem

Tailwind directives are added to components, but the styles are not applied. This often happens if the `content` array within the Tailwind config file doesn't accurately point to the files containing these directives.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring the `content` array includes all files or directories with Tailwind CSS directives, using appropriate globbing patterns to cover various file types (`.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.html`, etc.).  See the `bugSolution.js` file for a corrected `tailwind.config.js` file.
